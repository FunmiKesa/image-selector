"""
Dash app for grouping images and choosing the best per-group images. You also choose whether to delete any images in
that group.

Images can be loaded from a directory by clicking on the 'Select images' box and navigating to the correct folder. You
need only click on one image, then 'Open'. (Alternatively, drag and drop an image from the folder of interest into the
box.) Due to a technicality, you must select the correct directory from the dropdown menu, then click 'Load directory'.
This will load all valid image files from that directory (but not subdirectories). Images that fit into the left-hand
grid will be displayed immediately, but ALL images will be loaded in the background. In addition, the images will be
backed up to a subfolder in IMAGE_BACKUP_PATH (as raw data) and to directly into /tmp/ (for serving). Images are ordered
by the time they were taken.

Note: it is assumed that your images are stored under ~/Pictures (aka $HOME/Pictures for Unix-based systems).

Note: it is NOT recommended to host this app over the web -- only use it locally! The Dash framework (rightly) protects
      clients from being able to observe the server's folder structure, which makes this second step necessary. This
      program has very strong priveleges over the server's system, so only use it locally!

The left-hand side is a re-sizable grid of images: choose the size from the dropdown menu. You can zoom in on any image
(shown in the right-hand panel), by clicking on it, or by using the directional keys to navigate the blue square to it.

Each grid cell (td element) will have exactly one class name in {'grouped-off', 'grouped-on'}. There can be multiple cells
with grouped-on and it currently draws a red square around it. Together, the cells with a red border represent a group
of images. Those with the 'grouped-off' will (often) have no border, with one exception (i.e. having 'focus' - see below).
A cell can have 'grouped-on' or 'grouped-off' but not both. You make an image part of the group by clicking on it (It
must be on the image itself.) You can remove an image from a group by double clicking on it.

Additionally, one cell can have the special 'focus' class (currently blue border). This applies to one cell -
another cell will lose this when it is superceded. This class is achieved by clicking on a cell (that doesn't already
have it) or by moving the current highlighted cell around with the directional buttons / keys.

Note: there is a known bug when no cell has the focus and the user tries to 'complete the group' (causes error message
      but does not crash the program.)

Once you've chosen the images in the group, you should begin to label those images with whether you want to keep them
or not. Navigate to the image (directional keys or by clicking), then choose the 'Keep' or 'Delete' button to mark with
an additional thicker green or red border (respectively). For ease, you can also use the '=' or 's' key for keeping /
saving; and backspace or 'd' key for deletion.

Once you've marked all the grouped images up for keeping or deleting, check you're happy with the labels, then finalize
your choices by clicking 'Complete group'. There is currently no shortcut key for this operation. You must have marked
all images in the group, or the completion will not go through. If it works, those images will disappear from the grid
and new ones will appear. In the background, several things happen: 1) the meta data are added to a dictionary in memory
(and saved to a json file); 2) the meta data are inserted into the database and 3) most importantly, the images marked
for deletion ARE DELETED from the load folder (but not the backup folder). The main point of this program is to delete
bad duplicated images.

TODO: create an undo button that reverses the complete group operation.

Continue until ALL the images in that directory have been grouped and annotated before selecing and loading a new one.

# TODO: KNOWN BUG: select image directory > Load directory > Resize 4x4 > Click: {(0,1), (0,2), (0,3)} > Resize 5x5 / 3x3
#                   > Click Backspace / +

# TODO: KNOWN BUG: when there are images without timestamps, the image ordering is incorrect and can lead to bad data in
#                   the database / image-meta-data. However, this is an unlikely case.

    Global callback function for toggling classes. There are three toggle modes:
        1) Pressing a grid cell will toggle its state
        2) Pressing a directional button will force the "last-clicked" focus (only) to shift in the direction stated
        3) Resizing the grid will cause the top-left only to be in last-click focus
        4) Mark a cell as keep or delete (must already have "grouped-on" class)

    Note: some of these operations respond to key presses (e.g. directional buttons), which click hidden buttons.

    Args:
        n_rows = int, current number of rows in the grid (indicates resizing)
        n_cols = int, current number of columns in the grid (indicates resizing)
        n_left = int, number of clicks on the 'move-left' button (indicates shifting)
        n_right = int, number of clicks on the 'move-right' button (indicates shifting)
        n_up = int, number of clicks on the 'move-up' button (indicates shifting)
        n_down = int, number of clicks on the 'move-down' button (indicates shifting)
        n_keep = int, number of clicks on the 'keep-button' button
        n_delete = int, number of clicks on the 'delete-button' button
        image_list = dict, containing a list of Img objects under ['props']['children']
        image_data = dict, of dict of lists of ints, a sequence of metadata about completed image groups
        image_path = str, the filepath where the images in image-container were loaded from

        *args = positional arguments split into two equal halves (i.e. of length 2 x N_GRID):
            0) args[:N_GRID] are Inputs (activated by the grid-Buttons)
            1) args[N_GRID:] are States (indicating state of the grid-Tds)
            Both are in row-major order (for i in rows: for j in cols: ... )

    Returns: a list of new classNames for all the grid cells (plus one extra element for the Image that was last clicked)

    Note: args split into two halves:
        args[:N_GRID] are Inputs (Buttons)
        args[N_GRID:] are States (Tds)
